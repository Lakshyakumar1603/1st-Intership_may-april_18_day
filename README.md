Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of methods (functions). The four main principles of OOP are:

Encapsulation: Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class.
Inheritance: A class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
Polymorphism: A method can behave differently based on the object calling it, allowing one interface to be used for different data types.
Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
Python Basics:
Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its simplicity and readability. Some key basics include:

Variables: Used to store data, e.g., x = 5.
Data Types: Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
Control Structures: Python uses if, elif, else for conditionals and for, while for loops.
Functions: Reusable blocks of code defined using def, e.g., def my_function():.
Modules: Python allows importing pre-built libraries or creating custom ones, using import and from.
Both OOP and Python basics provide the foundation for writing efficient, modular, and easy-to-maintain code.
